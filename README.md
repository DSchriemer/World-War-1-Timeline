# World War 1 Timeline
This timeline is a webapp built with HTML, CSS, and Node.js.

I started working on this app while reading A World Undone by G.J. Meyer, and my goal with this app was to keep track of major events while improving my scalable web app design.

The animated ashes in the background was built using particles.js, which can be found [here](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)
